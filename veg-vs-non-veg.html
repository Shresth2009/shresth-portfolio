            About two months ago, something changed in our kitchen. My mother decided to stop cooking non-veg food due to religious reasons. So, my dad, brother, and I also shifted to a vegetarian diet. This made me curious — is this actually a better diet? Or were we missing something important?

        <p>
            I watched a detailed video by Gaurav Thakur on this topic and did some of my own research. I found out that this debate isn't about what's "right" or "wrong" — it’s about balance, health, and awareness.

        <h3>🥦 Benefits of a Veg/Vegan Diet:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rich in fiber, antioxidants, and natural nutrients.</li>
            <li>Helps in reducing cholesterol and preventing heart disease.</li>
            <li>Environmentally sustainable — less water and land usage.</li>
            <li>Many top athletes have switched to plant-based diets.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>🍗 Benefits of a Non-Veg Diet:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Great source of complete proteins like chicken, eggs, and fish.</li>
            <li>Provides Vitamin B12, iron, and Omega-3 — essential for brain and body.</li>
            <li>Helps in muscle growth and strength development.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>⚖️ My Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>
            Both diets have their pros and cons. If planned properly, a vegetarian diet can meet all nutritional needs. And if eaten in moderation, non-veg can be powerful too. So the real answer isn’t "Veg or Non-Veg", it’s “How educated are you about your food?”

            For me, this change taught a lot. Not just about health — but also about research, belief, and learning with curiosity. That’s what makes science and life both interesting!
